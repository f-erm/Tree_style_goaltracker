#### Graphical goaltracker

  This is a simple tool to help you split your goals into smaller subgoals and
  keep track of them. Goals will be displayed in a tree style. This Script
  includes all the functions to create, delete, rename, link, and complete your
  goals. As it is fairly intuitive, no tutorial is included. Just give it a shot
  and see wether you like it. I am always open to suggestions, though by now
  the project is pretty much closed.
